# Can Wholesale Electricity Prices Be Predicted Using A SARIMA Model?

## Motivation

This project was motivated by the ever increasing need for utilities, traders and policymakers to forecast wholesale electricity prices accurately despite increasing market volatility. Specifically, I wanted to provide a model which would answer the below question with a reasonable level of certainty.

*What will the wholesale price of electricity be for next month?*

## Setting Up The Solution

### Libraries Used

A list of the libraries used in my work is as follows:

- pandas
- numpy
- datetime

- tabulate
- matplotlib

### The Files

- NLMonthlyDA.csv : a csv file containing monthly average wholesale electricity prices in The Netherlands, dating back to January 2015.
